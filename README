CUSTOM BUTTONS (IMPLICIT)

This is a fork of the great work of Derek DeVries(1,2) and his, truly beautiful, 
custom styled cross browser buttons(3).

I've made a variant that implicitly styles any button element (with an inner
sliding-doors(4) span) instead of relying on a button-class for explicit style.

This fork also breaks away from full cross browser compatibility - because it's
time to leave IE 6 behind us. But style will be maintained, in generally, across
all the modern browsers currently available.

This makes it again possible to use sprite-based background images for button
graphics, and it generally reduces a bit of CSS in the process.

There are now also "skins", or extensions that simply breaks up into extra CSS
and image files. The files are organized in the following way:

 Three required files for default Custom Buttons (Implicit):
  
     css/
         button.css
         ie-button.css
     
     img/
         button.png
         
Theese three files will give the nice rounded look that Derek made. If you want
to add styles or "skins" you need to add pairs of skin files. Don't forget to
include the stylesheet on your HTML-page. Skin files are named like this:
 
     css/button-<skin-name>.css
     img/button-<skin-name>.png
